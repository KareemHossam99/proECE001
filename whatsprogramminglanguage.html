<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;">it's a group of commands, instructions and other terms use to make software programs
to do a certain task or make it easy to do tasks in a short time. 
Programs are made through languages called "high-level programming languages"
which is compiled into "low-level programming languages" using the compiler.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;">
	-a compiler is a computer program that translates high-level languages into 
		  a machine language <br>

		-high-level languages are designed to be easy for the programmers to deal with,
			read, understand and write using logical words and symbols which is reserved 
			in most programming languages like function, while, if, and else and symbols 
			like <, >, ==, and != most popular high level languages are c++ and java<br>

		-low-level languages are the machine languages and the assembly of the program
		  which include a list of commands <br> and instruction which are more difficult and 
		  complicated than <br> the higher-level programming languages<br>
</p>
